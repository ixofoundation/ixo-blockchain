# Messages

In this section we describe the processing of the token messages and the corresponding updates to the state. All created/modified state objects specified by each message are defined within the [state](./02_state.md) section.

## MsgCreateToken

A `MsgCreateToken` creates and stores a new Token struct (which is a class overview for minting tokens). Sets up the Token by initiating a cw1155 smart contract, and saving the address in the Token as well as a unique name (namespace).

```go
type MsgCreateToken struct {
	Minter string
	Class DIDFragment
	Name string
	Description string
	Image string
	TokenType string
	Cap github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Uint
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `minter` - a string containing the address of the minter
- `class` - a string containing the token protocol entity DID (validated)
- `name` - a string containing the token name, which must be unique (namespace)
- `description` - a string containing any arbitrary description
- `image` - a string containing the image url for the token
- `tokenType` - a string containing the token type eg. ixo1155
- `cap` - a integer containing the maximum number of tokens with this name that can be minted, 0 is unlimited

## MsgMintToken

A `MsgMintToken` mints tokens on the ixo1155 contract that was instantiate on the [Token](#token) creation. There will also be [TokenProperties](02_state.md#tokenproperties) created for each unique id.
Allows a Minter to directly mint the token with a name that is specified in the Token, and a unique index. The minted tokens `id` is a hex encoded md5 hash of the token `name` plus `index`, with no separators.

```go
type MsgMintToken struct {
	Minter          string
	ContractAddress string
	Owner     string
	MintBatch []*MintBatch
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `minter` - a string containing the address of the minter
- `contractAddress` - a string containing the contract address, same as the `ContractAddress` of the [Token](#token)
- `owner` - a string containing the address of the owner to mint the tokens for
- `mintBatch` - a list of [MintBatch](#mintbatch)

## MsgTransferToken

A `MsgTransferToken` transfers tokens on the ixo1155 contract that was instantiate on the [Token](#token) creation and where the tokens was minted.

```go
type MsgTransferToken struct {
	Owner string
	Recipient string
	Tokens []*TokenBatch
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `owner` - a string containing the address of the owner to transfer the tokens from
- `recipient` - a string containing the address of the owner to transfer the tokens to
- `tokens` - a list of [TokenBatch](#tokenbatch). All the tokens must be on the smart contract.

## MsgRetireToken

A `MsgRetireToken` burns the tokens on the ixo1155 contract that was instantiate on the [Token](#token) creation and where the tokens was minted. It also adds the retire details to the [Token](#token) `Retired` field to keep a record of the retire event. Retiring credits is permanent and cannot be undone.

```go
type MsgRetireToken struct {
	Owner string
	Tokens []*TokenBatch
	Jurisdiction string
	Reason string
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `owner` - a string containing the address of the owner of the tokens to retire
- `tokens` - a list of [TokenBatch](#tokenbatch). All the tokens must be on the smart contract.
- `reason` - a string containing any arbitrary reason that specifies the reason for retiring tokens.
- `jurisdiction` - a string containing the jurisdiction of the token owner. A jurisdiction has the format: <country-code>[-<sub-national-code>[ <postal-code>]] The country-code must be 2 alphabetic characters, the sub-national-code can be 1-3 alphanumeric characters, and the postal-code can be up to 64 alphanumeric characters. Only the country-code is required, while the sub-national-code and postal-code are optional and can be added for increased precision.

## MsgCancelToken

A `MsgCancelToken` burns the tokens on the ixo1155 contract that was instantiate on the [Token](#token) creation and where the tokens was minted. It also adds the cancel details to the [Token](#token) `Cancelled` field to keep a record of the cancel event.
Cancels a specified amount of tradable tokens, removing the amount from the token owner's tradable balance(by burning it) and removing the amount from the tokenâ€™s tradable supply. Cancelling credits is permanent and cannot be undone.

```go
type MsgCancelToken struct {
	Owner string
	Tokens []*TokenBatch
	Reason string
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `owner` - a string containing the address of the owner of the tokens to retire
- `tokens` - a list of [TokenBatch](#tokenbatch). All the tokens must be on the smart contract.
- `reason` - a string containing any arbitrary reason that specifies the reason for retiring tokens.

## MsgPauseToken

A `MsgPauseToken` changes the `Paused` field on the [Token](#token) which stops allowance of token minting temporarily if set to `true` or allow minting again if set to `false`

```go
type MsgPauseToken struct {
	Minter          string
	ContractAddress string
	Paused bool
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `minter` - a string containing the address of the minter, must be same as `Minter` of the [Token](#token), must also be the signers address
- `contractAddress` - a string containing the contract address, same as the `ContractAddress` of the [Token](#token)
- `paused` - a boolean indicating whether to stop allowance of token minting temporarily

## MsgStopToken

A `MsgPauseToken` changes the `Cancelled` field on the [Token](#token) which stops allowance of token minting permanently

```go
type MsgStopToken struct {
	Minter          string
	ContractAddress string
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `minter` - a string containing the address of the minter, must be same as `Minter` of the [Token](#token), must also be the signers address
- `contractAddress` - a string containing the contract address, same as the `ContractAddress` of the [Token](#token)

## Generic types

### MintBatch

A MintBatch allows batching mint token info

```go
type MintBatch struct {
	Name        string
	Index       string
	Amount      github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Uint
	Collection  string
	TokenData   []*TokenData
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `name` - a string containing the token name, which is same as [Token](02_state.md#token) `Name`
- `index` - a string containing the unique identifier hexstring that identifies the token
- `amount` - a integer indicating how many tokens must be minted for this unique `index` and generate `id`
- `collection` - a string containing the did of the "collection" the token was minted towards (eg. Supamoto Malawi Did)
- `tokenData` - a list of [TokenData](02_state.md#tokendata)

### TokenBatch

A TokenBatch allows batching tokens for transfering and retiring

```go
type TokenBatch struct {
	Id      string
	Amount  github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Uint
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `id` - a string containing the unique identifier of the token ([TokenProperties](#tokenproperties))
- `amount` - a integer indicating how many tokens is in the batch for the specified `id`
