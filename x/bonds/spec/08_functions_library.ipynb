    "# Functions Library\n",
    "The Bonds Module is deployed with a built-in set of libraries for commonly-used algorithmic pricing and reserve functions. It also includes algorithmic application logic and features, such as *Augmented Bonding*. Additional functions can be added to the Library through SDK updates. This requires a formal process of governance to approve updates, to assure the integrity of these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Types\n",
    "The following function types will be included in the standard Bonds SDK Module:\n",
    "* Power (exponential)\n",
    "* Logistic (sigmoidal)\n",
    "* Constant Product (swapper)\n",
    "* [Augmented Bonding Curves](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751) with [Alpha Bonds](https://github.com/BlockScience/Risk-Adjusted-Bonding-Curves) functionality (augmented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic Applications include:\n",
    "* Risk-adjusted bonding curves\n",
    "* Innovation Bonds (offers bond shareholders contingent rights to future IP rights and/or revenues)\n",
    "* Impact Bonds (offers bond shareholders contingent rights to success-based outcomes payments and/or rewards)\n",
