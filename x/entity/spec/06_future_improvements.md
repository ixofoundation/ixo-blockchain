# Future Improvements

As the decentralized landscape evolves, we're committed to enhancing the capabilities and functionalities of the `Entity` module. Future updates may include more granular metadata management, streamlined integration with external platforms, and expanded utility in decentralized finance and applications.

We welcome community contributions and feedback to make the `Entity` module even more robust and versatile.
