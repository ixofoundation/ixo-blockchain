# State

This document describes the state pertaining to:

1. [IidDocument](./02_state.md#identifier)
2. [IidMetadata](./02_state.md#didmetadata)

## IidDocument
DidDocuments are stored in the state under the `0x61` key and are stored using their ids

	KeyAgreement []string `protobuf:"bytes,8,rep,name=keyAgreement,proto3" json:"keyAgreement,omitempty"`
	
	// Used to specify a verification method that might be used by the IID subject
	// to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization
	// to update the IID Document.
	// https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#capability-invocation
	CapabilityInvocation []string `protobuf:"bytes,9,rep,name=capabilityInvocation,proto3" json:"capabilityInvocation,omitempty"`
	
	// Used to specify a mechanism that might be used by the IID subject
	// to delegate a cryptographic capability to another party.
	// https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#capability-delegation
	CapabilityDelegation []string          `protobuf:"bytes,10,rep,name=capabilityDelegation,proto3" json:"capabilityDelegation,omitempty"`
	LinkedResource       []*LinkedResource `protobuf:"bytes,11,rep,name=linkedResource,proto3" json:"linkedResource,omitempty"`
	AccordedRight        []*AccordedRight  `protobuf:"bytes,12,rep,name=accordedRight,proto3" json:"accordedRight,omitempty"`
	LinkedEntity         []*LinkedEntity   `protobuf:"bytes,13,rep,name=linkedEntity,proto3" json:"linkedEntity,omitempty"`
	AlsoKnownAs          string            `protobuf:"bytes,14,opt,name=alsoKnownAs,proto3" json:"alsoKnownAs,omitempty"`
}

### Verification Method

Verification methods are stored within an IidDocument and are used to store public key information as described in the [W3C DID recommendations](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#verification-methods).

A verification method has the following fields:

- `id` - a string containing the unique identifier of the verification method (required).
- `type` - a string the type of verification method 
- `controller` - a string containing the did of the owner of the key 
- `verificationMaterial`: a string that is either   
  - `blockchainAccountID` - a string representing a cosmos based account address
  - `publicKeyHex` - a string representing a public key encoded as a hex string
  - `publicKeyMultibase` - a string representing a public key encoded according to the Multibase Data Format [Hexadecimal upper-case encoding](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase#appendix-B.1)
