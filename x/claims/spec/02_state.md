# State

## Collections

A Collections is stored in the state and is accessed by the identity of the collection that is fetched and incremented onchain using the `Param`: `CollectionSequence`.

- Collections: `0x01 | collectionId -> ProtocolBuffer(Collection)`

## Claims

A Claim is stored in the state and is accessed by the identity of the ClaimId(user provided).

- Claims: `0x02 | claimId -> ProtocolBuffer(Claim)`

## Disputes

A Dispute is stored in the state and is accessed by the SubjectId of the dispute(user provided).

- Disputes: `0x03 | disputeSubjectId(DID) -> ProtocolBuffer(Dispute)`
