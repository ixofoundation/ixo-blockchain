# Messages

In this section we describe the processing of the claims messages and the corresponding updates to the state. All created/modified state objects specified by each message are defined within the [state](./02_state.md) section.

## MsgCreateCollection

A `MsgCreateCollection` creates and stores a new Collection which defines protocols, quotas and payments for claim submissions and evaluations

```go
type MsgCreateCollection struct {
	Entity string
	Signer string
	Protocol string
	StartDate *time.Time
	EndDate *time.Time
	Quota uint64
	State CollectionState
	Payments *Payments
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `entity` - a string containing the DID of the entity for which the claims are being created
- `signer` - a string containing the account address of the private key signing the transaction
- `protocol` - a string containing the DID of the claim protocol
- `startDate` - a timestamp of the start date for the collection, after which claims may be submitted
- `endDate` - a timestamp of the end date for the collection, after which no more claims may be submitted (no endDate is allowed)
- `quota` - a integer containing the maximum number of claims that may be submitted, 0 is unlimited
- `state` - a [CollectionState](02_state.md#collectionstate)
- `payments` - a [Payments](02_state.md#payments)

## MsgSubmitClaim

A `MsgSubmitClaim` creates and stores a new Claim made towards a `Collection`. On Submission of claim `SUBMISSION` payments will be made if there is any defined in the [Collection](02_state.md#collection) `Payments`.

```go
type MsgSubmitClaim struct {
	CollectionId string
	ClaimId string
	AgentDid  DIDFragment
	AgentAddress string
	AdminAddress string
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `collectionId` - a string containing the Collection `id` this claim belongs
- `agentAddress` - a string containing the account address that is submitting the claim
- `agentDid` - a string containing the Did of the agent that is submitting the claim
- `adminAddress` - a string containing the account address defined in the [Collection](02_state.md#collection) `admin` field

## MsgEvaluateClaim

A `MsgEvaluateClaim` updates the `Evaluation` for a claim. On evaluation payments will be made for both the evaluation of the claim (towards the agent or oracle) as well as if the claim was `APPROVED` then the claim submitter will also get a payment, which will the preset amount defined on th [Collection](02_state.md#collection) `Payments` field or the evaluator can also define a custom `Amount` that can be paid out on approval.

```go
type MsgEvaluateClaim struct {
  ClaimId string
	CollectionId string
	Oracle string
	AgentDid  DIDFragment
	AgentAddress string
	AdminAddress string
	Status EvaluationStatus
	Reason uint32
	VerificationProof string
	Amount github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Coins
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `claimId` - a string containing the `id` of the claim the evaluation is for
- `collectionId` - a string containing the Collection `id` the claim this evaluation is for belongs to
- `oracle` - a string containing the DID of the Oracle entity that is evaluating the claim
- `agentAddress` - a string containing the account address that is submitting the evaluation
- `agentDid` - a string containing the Did of the agent that is submitting the evaluation
- `adminAddress` - a string containing the account address defined in the [Collection](02_state.md#collection) `admin` field
- `status` - a [EvaluationStatus](#evaluationstatus)
- `reason` - a integer for why the evaluation result was given (codes defined by evaluator)
- `verificationProof` - a string containing the proof to verify the linked resource (eg. the cid of the evaluation Verfiable Credential)
- `amount` - a [Coins](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/types/coin.go#L180) object which denotes the coins and amount to be paid on `Approval` payment if it is a custom amount and not the preset `Approval` from the [Collection](#collection)

## MsgDisputeClaim

A `MsgDisputeClaim` creates and stores a new Dispute.

```go
type MsgDisputeClaim struct {
	SubjectId string
	AgentDid    DIDFragment
	AgentAddress string
	DisputeType int32
	Data        *DisputeData
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `subjectId` - a string containing the `id` of the claim the dispute is for. A unique field
- `disputeType` - a integer interpreted by the client
- `data` - a [DisputeData](02_state.md#disputedata)
- `agentAddress` - a string containing the account address that is submitting the dispute
- `agentDid` - a string containing the Did of the agent that is submitting the dispute

## MsgWithdrawPayment

A `MsgWithdrawPayment` creates and stores a new Withdrawal Payment which contains details about a payment that can be made if the `TimeoutNs` in a [Payment](02_state.md#payment) is non 0, which means the payout won't happen on submission/evaluation but an authz gets granted with the receiver as grantee that allows the execution of this message after the `ReleaseDate`. This will allow the receiver to execute the payout through a [MsgExec](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/authz#msgexec) to execute the authz.

```go
type MsgWithdrawPayment struct {
	ClaimId string
	Inputs []github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_x_bank_types.Input
	Outputs []github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_x_bank_types.Output
	PaymentType PaymentType
	Contract_1155Payment *Contract1155Payment
	ToAddress string
	FromAddress string
	ReleaseDate *time.Time
	AdminAddress string
}
```

The field's descriptions is as follows:

- `claimId` - a string containing the `id` of the claim the withdrawal is for
- `inputs` - a list of cosmos defined `Input` to pass to the the multisend tx to run to withdraw payment
- `outputs` - a list of cosmos defined `Output` to pass to the the multisend tx to run to withdraw payment
- `paymentType` - a [PaymentType](02_state.md#paymenttype)
- `contract_1155Payment` - a [Contract1155Payment](02_state.md#contract1155payment)
- `toAddress` - a string containing the account address to make the payment to
- `fromAddress` - a string containing the account address to make the payment from
- `releaseDate` - a timestamp of the date that grantee can execute authorization to make the withdrawal payment, calculated from created date plus the timeout on [Collection](02_state.md#collection) `Payments`
- `adminAddress` - a string containing the account address defined in the [Collection](02_state.md#collection) `admin` field
