# Future Improvements

The ixo system continually evolves to offer more sophisticated, efficient, and streamlined solutions. Some proposed enhancements in the pipeline for the Claims module include:

### Agent Authorization for Group Accounts

To diminish the administrative overhead, agents could be authorized not just for individual accounts but for group accounts. Consider a scenario involving a Project Entity with a defined group of Service Agents. Any member from this group might have the capability to submit claims. The essential task then is only to oversee and manage the group membership, which happens outside the purview of the Claims module.

### Auto-Authorization for Claim Submission

In scenarios like public campaigns where agent identification isn't crucial, agents might be permitted to submit claims without preliminary authorization. This open approach, however, carries risks like potential spamming or DDoS attacks. To mitigate such threats, a proposal suggests limiting each agent DID to submit only a defined number of claims.

These planned improvements emphasize the commitment to making the Claims module more adaptive and in tune with diverse project requirements while preserving system security and efficiency.
