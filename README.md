The ixo Blockchain is a Layer 1 blockchain that runs on both Testnet and Mainnet. It is built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main), [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/), and [IBC](https://ibc.cosmos.network/), and was one of the earliest networks to incorporate these technologies.

Have a look at [go.mod](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-blockchain/blob/main/go.mod) for specific dependencies and their most recent versions.

The ixo Blockchain powers client applications for coordinating, financing and verifying impacts. The [Impacts Wallet](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-Mobile-dev), [JAMBO](https://github.com/ixofoundation/jambo), and [Launchpad](https://github.com/ixofoundation/ixo-webclient) are examples of client applications that use the ixo Blockchain. The [Impacts SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ixo/impactxclient-sdk) makes it simple to interact with the ixo Blockchain.

Ixo has 8 custom cosmos modules which help to reach the Ixo goals and missions:
